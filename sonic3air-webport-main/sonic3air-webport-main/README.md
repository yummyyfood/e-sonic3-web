### About Repository
I did not compile this myself, all I did was extract all the files from Sappharad's Web Port (and technecally an IOS Port) straight from [his website](https://projects.sappharad.com/s3air_ios/20240202_beta/)

Special thanks to him for doing it for me

Honestly, he should've just released the files from the start, but at least I have a reason to stall my other web ports (yes I have more)

Also as a bonus, touch controls work as well, so I guess its a IOS port as well (And please read the entire readme, it holds lots of info)

### To Run this yourself
- Get the files from this repo (Code -> Download ZIP or download from the Releases Page)
- Put the files in a web server (Because I'm 99.99% sure this was made by Emscripten, it CANNOT be run locally with the file:// protocol, as that results in CORS issues because of Emscripten Limitations)
- Open sonic3air_web.html from within your website (https:// (your domain) /sonic3air_web.html)

> Or you could place all the files into the root of your github.io repo and host it through github.io pages

### To run this Locally
If you want to run this locally, use something like python to run a temporary web server on your machine

To do this using Python, you do by
- Again, Get the files from this repo (Code -> Download ZIP / Download from Releases Page)
- Entering the directory containing sonic3air_web.html and other files and typing the command python3 -m http.server in the linux terminal or py -m http.server for windows powershell given you installed python
- At which point you can enter http://localhost:8000/sonic3air_web.html to play the game locally

Also, you still need to have Sonic_Knuckles_wSonic3.bin as of now, but this repo will have it for you, and I will try and see if I can change it to just include it within the same server it is hosted on

### To Extract the Assets for Yourself
Read [EXTRACTING.md](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/sonic3air-webport/blob/main/EXTRACTING.md) for that (if you really want to)

### MODS!
This port does have A.I.R. mod support, but you can only access the mods folder by exiting the game within the main menu, and then restarting it after you uploaded your mod of choice within the mod folder
> Also, you can download Higher Quality Music Files within this File Manager by pressing Extra Downloads -> Install Anyway
